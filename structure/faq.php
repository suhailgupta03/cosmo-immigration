You may use some or all of the available 12 months of practical training during your course of study or save the full twelve months to use after you complete your studies. Authorization for optional practical training is granted by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) formerly known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service or INS - and can take at least 90 days and frequently up to 120 days to obtain. It is important that you apply for the authorization at the earliest possible date.

                                Many colleges have Pathway programmes validated by a university that allow you to prepare for a degree course. They last from six months to a year and teach you a variety of subjects, including the one you plan to study – English, study skills, research and more. They are sometimes called foundation, diploma or pre masters courses as well. They can be studied in the UK or in India as well.

                                The most common type is Halls of residence. These are accommodation blocks where each student has their own room. Some of the newer ones have rooms that have their own toilet and shower (en suite), but usually you share the flat with other people. Self-catering halls have kitchens for about the same number of people, where you can cook your own food. Catered halls have a dining hall where you are served at least two meals a day: breakfast and dinner. Halls will have cleaners and may have a laundry for bedclothes. Bills for electricity, lighting, heating and water will be included in the rent.

                                Most of the courses don’t require any test as British universities accept the Indian academic marks, but a few professional courses like LLB and Medicine require tests like LNAT and UKCAT respectively.

                                The academic grades are the most important criteria of admission to a British university. Sports and extracurricular activities better your profile in comparison to others, especially for scholarships, Job Interviews etc. There are a few scholarships which you will be eligible for based on the sport played.Eg: Cardiff

                               By and large British universities have a rolling admission process with no deadlines except in certain cases. At the UG level, University of Oxford and University of Cambridge have a deadline of 15 October of the year preceding the year of entry. This is also true for all the clinical courses. Eg: 15 October 2015 is the deadline for September 2016. At the PG level some universities may have deadlines, or may have to stop taking applications if there is the danger of a popular course being oversubscribed. So it is always better to apply well in time especially if you are looking at applying for programmes that are competitive or you wish to apply for scholarships.

                                Scholarships are usually merit based. So the first criterion is academic marks. You have to have an offer from the university which you need to accept. Most scholarships require you to write an essay on a given topic, and some may have an interview as well. Your CV should stand out as scholarships are very competitive.
